BeerDuino
=========

Arduino code for a beer fermenter parameters SD datalogger.

The repository contains different files for the arduino IDE for reading and writing to an Sd card using the ethernet 
shield and reading a IR gate, a temperature and weight sensor. You can take a look at the detailed description of them 
on my website at www.opensourceideas.it under the section Elettronica -> Beer Logger. 

This code is distributed under GNU public license, you are free to use and modify it. I just ask you to cite me and my 
website if you work with it.
